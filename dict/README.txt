This folder contains 2 syllable dictionaries. The original is a complete dictionary with a syllable count for each word. The optimized dictionary is a heavily reduced file for the specific use with the Lawrence App. If you want to create your own program with a syllable dictionary, you may wish to use the original file. 

Cheers,
Troy
